# CSE Code Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code, projects, and assignments developed during my Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) studies. It is organized by semester and then by course/topic, providing a structured overview of my academic progress and practical skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is primarily organized into `Semester 1`, `Semester 2`, and `Semester 3` directories. Each semester directory contains subdirectories for different courses or major topics covered during that period.

### Semester 1
Contains code and projects from the first semester, primarily focusing on foundational programming concepts.
-   **C Programming:** Assignments and practice problems in C.
-   **C#:** Various modules and assignments related to C# programming.
-   **C++ for DSA:** Code related to Data Structures and Algorithms using C++.

### Semester 2
Covers more advanced topics, including algorithms and data structures.
-   **Algorithm:** Assignments and practice problems related to algorithms.
-   **Basic Data Structures:** Code examples and assignments for fundamental data structures.
-   **Data Structure:** Further exploration and implementation of data structures.

### Semester 3
Focuses on web development, scripting, and object-oriented programming.
-   **Code:** General Python scripts and practice files.
-   **Django:** Projects and assignments using the Django web framework, including different modules covering various aspects of Django development.
-   **Front-End:** Web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including assignments and practice days.
-   **Python & OOP:** Assignments and practice problems related to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Technologies Used

This repository showcases projects and code utilizing a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including but not limited to:

-   **Programming Languages:** Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript
-   **Web Frameworks:** Django
-   **Front-End Technologies:** HTML, CSS

## How to Navigate
